## DESCRIPTION:

Pico web framework for building API-centric web applications.
For Rack applications or Rack middlewares. Around 250 lines of code.

## DESIGN:

* Learn the HTTP way instead of using some pointless helpers.
* Learn the Rack way instead of wrapping around Rack functionalities.
* Learn regular expression for routes instead of custom syntax.
* Embrace simplicity over convenience.
* Don't make things complicated only for _some_ convenience, but for
  _great_ convenience, or simply stay simple for simplicity.
* More features are added as extensions.
* Consider use [rack-protection][] if you're not only building an API server.
* Consider use [websocket_parser][] if you're trying to use WebSocket.
  Please check example below.

[rack-protection]: https://github.com/rkh/rack-protection
[websocket_parser]: https://github.com/afcapel/websocket_parser

## FEATURES:

* Minimal
* Simple
* Modular
* No templates (You could use [tilt](https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt))
* No ORM (You could use [sequel](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/))
* No `dup` in `call`
* Regular expression routes, e.g. `get %r{^/(?<id>\d+)$}`
* String routes, e.g. `get '/'`
* Custom routes, e.g. `get Matcher.new`
* Build for either Rack applications or Rack middleware
* Include extensions for more features (There's a Sinatra extension)

## WHY?

Because Sinatra is too complex and inconsistent for me.

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Tested with MRI (official CRuby), Rubinius and JRuby.

## INSTALLATION:

    gem install jellyfish

## SYNOPSIS:

You could also take a look at [config.ru](config.ru) as an example, which
also uses [Swagger](https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) to generate
API documentation.

### Hello Jellyfish, your lovely config.ru

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/' do
    "Jelly Kelly\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '12', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Jelly Kelly\n"]]
-->

### Regular expression routes

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get %r{^/(?<id>\d+)$} do |match|

class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  post '/' do
    headers       'X-Jellyfish-Life' => '100'
    headers_merge 'X-Jellyfish-Mana' => '200'
    body "Jellyfish 100/200\n"
    status 201

  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
POST /
[201,
 {'Content-Length' => '18', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain',
  'X-Jellyfish-Life' => '100', 'X-Jellyfish-Mana' => '200'},
 ["Jellyfish 100/200\n"]]
-->

### Redirect helper

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/lookup' do
    found "#{env['rack.url_scheme']}://#{env['HTTP_HOST']}/"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /lookup
body = File.read("#{File.dirname(
  File.expand_path(__FILE__))}/../lib/jellyfish/public/302.html").
  gsub('VAR_URL', ':///')
[302,
 {'Content-Length' => body.bytesize.to_s, 'Content-Type' => 'text/html',
  'Location' => ':///'},
 [body]]
-->

### Crash-proof

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/crash' do
    raise 'crash'
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /crash
body = File.read("#{File.dirname(
  File.expand_path(__FILE__))}/../lib/jellyfish/public/500.html")
[500,
 {'Content-Length' => body.bytesize.to_s, 'Content-Type' => 'text/html'},
 [body]]
-->

### Custom error handler

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  handle NameError do |e|
    status 403
    "No one hears you: #{e.backtrace.first}\n"
  end
  get '/yell' do
    yell
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /yell
body = case RUBY_ENGINE
       when 'jruby'
         "No one hears you: (eval):9:in `Tank'\n"
       when 'rbx'
         "No one hears you: kernel/delta/kernel.rb:78:in `yell (method_missing)'\n"
       else
         "No one hears you: (eval):9:in `block in <class:Tank>'\n"
       end
[403,
 {'Content-Length' => body.bytesize.to_s, 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 [body]]
-->

### Custom error 404 handler

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  handle Jellyfish::NotFound do |e|
    status 404
    "You found nothing."
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /
[404,
 {'Content-Length' => '18', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["You found nothing."]]
-->

### Custom error handler for multiple errors

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  handle Jellyfish::NotFound, NameError do |e|
    status 404
    "You found nothing."
  end
  get '/yell' do
    yell
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /
[404,
 {'Content-Length' => '18', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["You found nothing."]]
-->

### Access Rack::Request and params

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/report' do
    "Your name is #{request.params['name']}\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /report?name=godfat
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '20', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Your name is godfat\n"]]
-->

### Re-dispatch the request with modified env

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/report' do
    status, headers, body = jellyfish.call(env.merge('PATH_INFO' => '/info'))
    self.status  status
    self.headers headers
    self.body    body
  end
  get('/info'){ "OK\n" }
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /report
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '3', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["OK\n"]]
-->

### Include custom helper in built-in controller

Basically it's the same as defining a custom controller and then
include the helper. This is merely a short hand. See next section
for defining a custom controller.

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Heater
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    temperature
  end

  module Helper
    def temperature
      "30\u{2103}\n"
    end
  end
  controller_include Helper
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Heater.new
```

<!---
GET /status
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '6', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["30\u{2103}\n"]]
-->

### Define custom controller manually

This is effectively the same as defining a helper module as above and
include it, but more flexible and extensible.

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Heater
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    temperature
  end

  class Controller < Jellyfish::Controller
    def temperature
      "30\u{2103}\n"
    end
  end
  controller Controller
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Heater.new
```

<!---
GET /status
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '6', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["30\u{2103}\n"]]
-->

### Override dispatch for processing before action

We don't have before action built-in, but we could override `dispatch` in
the controller to do the same thing. CAVEAT: Remember to call `super`.

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Module.new{
    def dispatch
      @state = 'jumps'
      super
    end
  }

  get do
    "Jelly #{@state}.\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /123
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '13', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Jelly jumps.\n"]]
-->

### Extension: MultiActions (Filters)

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Jellyfish::MultiActions

  get do # wildcard before filter
    @state = 'jumps'
  end
  get do
    "Jelly #{@state}.\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /123
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '13', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Jelly jumps.\n"]]
-->

### Extension: NormalizedParams (with force_encoding)

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Jellyfish::NormalizedParams

  get %r{^/(?<id>\d+)$} do
    "Jelly ##{params[:id]}\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /123
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '11', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Jelly #123\n"]]
-->

### Extension: NormalizedPath (with unescaping)

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Jellyfish::NormalizedPath

  get "/\u{56e7}" do
    "#{env['PATH_INFO']}=#{path_info}\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /%E5%9B%A7
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '16', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["/%E5%9B%A7=/\u{56e7}\n"]]
-->

### Extension: Sinatra flavoured controller

It's an extension collection contains:

* MultiActions
* NormalizedParams
* NormalizedPath

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Jellyfish::Sinatra

  get do # wildcard before filter
    @state = 'jumps'
  end
  get %r{^/(?<id>\d+)$} do
    "Jelly ##{params[:id]} #{@state}.\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /123
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '18', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Jelly #123 jumps.\n"]]
-->

### Extension: NewRelic

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Jellyfish::NewRelic

  get '/' do
    "OK\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
require 'cgi' # newrelic dev mode needs this and it won't require it itself
require 'new_relic/rack/developer_mode'
use NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode # GET /newrelic to read stats
run Tank.new
NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:developer_mode => true)
```

<!---
GET /
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '3', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["OK\n"]]
-->

### Extension: Using multiple extensions with custom controller

This is effectively the same as using Jellyfish::Sinatra extension.
Note that the controller should be assigned lastly in order to include
modules remembered in controller_include.

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  class MyController < Jellyfish::Controller
    include Jellyfish::MultiActions
  end
  controller_include NormalizedParams, NormalizedPath
  controller MyController

  get do # wildcard before filter
    @state = 'jumps'
  end
  get %r{^/(?<id>\d+)$} do
    "Jelly ##{params[:id]} #{@state}.\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /123
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '18', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Jelly #123 jumps.\n"]]
-->

### Jellyfish as a middleware

If the Jellyfish middleware cannot find a corresponding action, it would
then forward the request to the lower application. We call this `cascade`.

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Heater
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    "30\u{2103}\n"
  end
end

class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/' do
    "Jelly Kelly\n"
  end
end

use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
use Heater
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '12', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Jelly Kelly\n"]]
-->

### Modify response as a middleware

We could also explicitly call the lower app. This would give us more
flexibility than simply forwarding it.

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Heater
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    status, headers, body = jellyfish.app.call(env)
    self.status  status
    self.headers headers
    self.body    body
    headers_merge('X-Temperature' => "30\u{2103}")
  end
end

class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    "See header X-Temperature\n"
  end
end

use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
use Heater
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /status
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '25', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain',
  'X-Temperature'  => "30\u{2103}"},
 ["See header X-Temperature\n"]]
-->

### Override cascade for customized forwarding

We could also override `cascade` in order to craft custom response when
forwarding is happening. Note that whenever this forwarding is happening,
Jellyfish won't try to merge the headers from `dispatch` method, because
in this case Jellyfish is served as a pure proxy. As result we need to
explicitly merge the headers if we really want.

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Heater
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Module.new{
    def dispatch
      headers_merge('X-Temperature' => "35\u{2103}")
      super
    end

    def cascade
      status, headers, body = jellyfish.app.call(env)
      halt [status, headers_merge(headers), body]
    end
  }
end

class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    "\n"
  end
end

use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
use Heater
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /status
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '1', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain',
  'X-Temperature'  => "35\u{2103}"},
 ["\n"]]
-->

### Simple before action as a middleware

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Heater
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    env['temperature'] = 30
    cascade
  end
end

class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    "#{env['temperature']}\u{2103}\n"
  end
end

use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
use Heater
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /status
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '6', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["30\u{2103}\n"]]
-->

### Halt in before action

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Jellyfish::MultiActions

  get do # wildcard before filter
    body "Done!\n"
    halt
  end
  get '/' do
    "Never reach.\n"
  end
end

use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /status
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '6', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Done!\n"]]
-->

### One huge tank

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Heater
  include Jellyfish
  get '/status' do
    "30\u{2103}\n"
  end
end

class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/' do
    "Jelly Kelly\n"
  end
end

HugeTank = Rack::Builder.app do
  use Rack::ContentLength
  use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
  use Heater
  run Tank.new
end

run HugeTank
```

<!---
GET /status
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '6', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["30\u{2103}\n"]]
-->

### Raise exceptions

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Protector
  include Jellyfish
  handle StandardError do |e|
    "Protected: #{e}\n"
  end
end

class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  handle_exceptions false # default is true, setting false here would make
                          # the outside Protector handle the exception
  get '/' do
    raise "Oops, tank broken"
  end
end

use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
use Protector
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /
[200,
 {'Content-Length' => '29', 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'},
 ["Protected: Oops, tank broken\n"]]
-->

### Chunked transfer encoding (streaming) with Jellyfish::ChunkedBody

You would need a proper server setup.
Here's an example with Rainbows and fibers:

``` ruby
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/chunked' do
    ChunkedBody.new{ |out|
      (0..4).each{ |i| out.call("#{i}\n") }
    }
  end
end
use Rack::Chunked
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /chunked
[200,
 {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain', 'Transfer-Encoding' => 'chunked'},
 ["2\r\n0\n\r\n", "2\r\n1\n\r\n", "2\r\n2\n\r\n",
  "2\r\n3\n\r\n", "2\r\n4\n\r\n", "0\r\n\r\n"]]
-->

### Chunked transfer encoding (streaming) with custom body

``` ruby
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  class Body
    def each
      (0..4).each{ |i| yield "#{i}\n" }
    end
  end
  get '/chunked' do
    Body.new
  end
end
use Rack::Chunked
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /chunked
[200,
 {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain', 'Transfer-Encoding' => 'chunked'},
 ["2\r\n0\n\r\n", "2\r\n1\n\r\n", "2\r\n2\n\r\n",
  "2\r\n3\n\r\n", "2\r\n4\n\r\n", "0\r\n\r\n"]]
-->

### Server Sent Event (SSE)

``` ruby
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  class Body
    def each
      (0..4).each{ |i| yield "data: #{i}\n\n" }
    end
  end
  get '/sse' do
    headers_merge('Content-Type' => 'text/event-stream')
    Body.new
  end
end
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /sse
[200,
 {'Content-Type' => 'text/event-stream'},
 ["data: 0\n\n", "data: 1\n\n", "data: 2\n\n", "data: 3\n\n", "data: 4\n\n"]]
-->

### Server Sent Event (SSE) with Rack Hijacking

``` ruby
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get '/sse' do
    headers_merge(
      'Content-Type' => 'text/event-stream',
      'rack.hijack'  => lambda do |sock|
        (0..4).each do |i|
          sock.write("data: #{i}\n\n")
        end
        sock.close
      end)
  end
end
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /sse
[200,
 {'Content-Type' => 'text/event-stream'},
 ["data: 0\n\n", "data: 1\n\n", "data: 2\n\n", "data: 3\n\n", "data: 4\n\n"]]
-->

### Using WebSocket

Note that this only works for Rack servers which support [hijack][].
You're better off with a threaded server such as [Rainbows!][] with
thread based concurrency model, or [Puma][].

Event-driven based server is a whole different story though. Since
EventMachine is basically dead, we could see if there would be a
[Celluloid-IO][] based web server production ready in the future,
so that we could take the advantage of event based approach.

[hijack]: http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rack/rack/file/SPEC#Hijacking
[Rainbows!]: http://rainbows.bogomips.org/
[Puma]: http://puma.io/
[Celluloid-IO]: https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-io

``` ruby
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  controller_include Jellyfish::WebSocket
  get '/echo' do
    switch_protocol do |msg|
      ws_write(msg)
    end
    ws_write('Hi!')
    ws_start
  end
end
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /echo
sock.string.should.eq <<-HTTP.chomp
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols\r
Upgrade: websocket\r
Connection: Upgrade\r
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: Kfh9QIsMVZcl6xEPYxPHzW8SZ8w=\r
\r
\x81\u0003Hi!
HTTP
[200, {}, ['']]

### Use Swagger to generate API documentation

For a complete example, checkout [config.ru](config.ru).

``` ruby
require 'jellyfish'
class Tank
  include Jellyfish
  get %r{^/(?<id>\d+)$}, :notes => 'This is an API note' do |match|
    "Jelly ##{match[:id]}\n"
  end
end
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
map '/swagger' do
  run Jellyfish::Swagger.new('', Tank)
end
run Tank.new
```

<!---
GET /swagger
[200,
 {'Content-Type'   => 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
  'Content-Length' => '81'},
 ['{"swaggerVersion":"1.2","info":{},"apiVersion":"0.1.0","apis":[{"path":"/{id}"}]}']]
